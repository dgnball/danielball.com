![paas.png](/assets/images/projects/paas.png)

Working with the development team on [LITE](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/7191).

This is a web-based app for issuing export licenses being developed by the UK government.

The software uses a combination of
Python, Django, Postgres, Cloud Foundry on AWS ([Gov PAAS](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk)), Apache Airflow and
Selenium (for testing) as well as a multitude of other digital services and technologies.

Predominantly, I worked as a backend developer of Django services. However, it has also
involved writing automated tests using Selenium, generating reports using Postgres queries
and providing support. Much of the work is done using public Github and can be viewed at
