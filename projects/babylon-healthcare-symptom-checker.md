Developing and maintaining backend Python and Flask-based microservices for a healthcare
app. A large part of the work was helping with testing and software releases, which was
safety critical, so involved a lot of different stakeholders and was process heavy. However, a
lot of automation was used based on a wide variety of CI tools including Circle CI, Jenkins,
GitHub actions and Azure Devops.

Aside from working to improve the release process,I worked on refactoring part of the backend set of microservices
that connected the rules-based symptom checker logic (written in Scala) to the front-end component (Node-based). The microservices
I worked on were written in Python and used Flask to translate the JSON data between the two parts of the system.
