This two-year block in my career was when I broke away from longer-term engagements to work on a series of shorter projects. As this was post-Covid, most of these were remote. The photo above was taken during a visit to the London headquarters of Babylon Health.

* [Vodafone UK](https://www.vodafone.co.uk) via [MMT-digital](https://mmtdigital.co.uk/) as an SRE for their consumer-facing web assets. Details are [here](/projects/test-framework-for-vodafone-co-uk).
* [Babylon Healthcare](https://www.babylonhealth.com) as a Python engineer. See the [Babylon Healthcare Symptom Checker](/projects/babylon-healthcare-symptom-checker) project.
