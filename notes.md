title: Notes 📝
---

This is a bit like a blog but without the pressure of having to churn out an article every week. I'll be posting notes on things I've learned, what I'm working on and stuff I find interesting.

* [AI Glossary](notes/ai_glossary) - A glossary of AI terms with a focus on LLMs
* [Tools and Resources](notes/tools) - My bookmarks
* [AI Agents](notes/ai_agents) - My attempt to explain what is meant by the term "AI agent" with examples and resources
