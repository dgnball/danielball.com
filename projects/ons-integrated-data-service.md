Working in partnership with [Qodea](https://qodea.com/) on the [Integrated Data Service](https://integrateddataservice.gov.uk/).

Contributed as a full-stack Python developer to the (IDS), a cross-government platform that provides secure access to high-quality data. The project spans web, backend Python and DevOps using Flask, Jinja, HTML/CSS and Nunjucks. For DevOps, we used infrastructure-as-code with Terraform and deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

I also played a key role in agile delivery and team development, mentoring junior developers and supporting collaborative, user-focused delivery.
