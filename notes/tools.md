[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

This is a (not exhaustive) list of tools and web resources I choose to use, plus those I wish to evaluate. It is somewhat inspired by 
[awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). It is leaning towards free or cheap tools and resources. I've created this as bookmarks aren't really working for me and I wanted to share ðŸ˜€
